#  What is CampoBet bacarrat?

Campobet Baccarat is a type of casino game that uses cards to determine the outcome. This game is similar to blackjack, where the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. In Baccarat however, players are trying to get a total of 9, or as close as possible.

In Campobet Baccarat, the player and the banker are both dealt two cards. The player’s cards are totaled and compared to the banker’s cards. If the player has a total of 9 or higher, they win automatically. If the player has a total of 8 or lower, they lose automatically. If the player has a total of exactly 9, it is called a “natural” and they win automatically. If the player has a total that is not 9, the final sum is determined by adding up the values of each card. The Ace is worth 1 point, 2 through 9 are worth face value, and 10 through King are worth 0 points. The highest hand in Campobet Baccarat is therefore 9 (2 + 7). The lowest hand is 0 (Ace + King).

If there is a tie (both players have the same total), the bet pushes and neither side wins or loses money.

# How do I play CampoBet bacarrat?

The dealer will give two cards to both players and two cards to themselves (the banker). The leftmost card in each players hand will be facing up, while their second card will be face down.  Players must place their bets before any cards are shown. After all bets have been placed, each player will pick up their 2nd card - this will show their 2nd card's value.  At this point in time if you wish to leave/fold you may however if you remain in then both player and dealer turn over their respective cards simultaneously - one reveals its face value & suits whilst announcing either "player" or "banker". Wins pays out at even money e.g £10 bet = £10 payout etc

#  How to play CampoBet bacarrat? 

CampoBet is a great place for playing baccarat. The game has simple rules and it is easy to understand how to play CampoBet baccarat. So, let’s start with the basics.

CampoBet baccarat is played with 8 decks of cards. The aim of the game is to get as close to 9 as possible. There are three possible outcomes in CampoBet baccarat: player, banker and tie. 

The player and banker bets are both betting on one of these outcomes. To win, your chosen outcome must have a score that is closer to 9 than the other outcome. If the chosen outcome has the same score as the other outcome, it is called a “push” and you get your original bet back. 

There are different betting options when playing CampoBet baccarat. You can either bet on the player, banker or tie, or you can bet on a specific combination of player and banker bets (such as 1-3). The odds vary depending on which option you choose. 

When you first start playing CampoBet baccarat, it is important to understand the different scores. In CampoBet baccarat, card values are different from those in blackjack. The ace counts as 1 and all other cards are worth their face value. So, for example, if you were dealt an 8 and a 3, your total would be 11 (8+3=11). 

To begin CampoBet baccarat, both the player and banker hands are dealt two cards each. The player’s hand is always dealt first. If the player’s first two cards add up to more than 10, then only the second card is counted (e.g., an Ace and a 6 would be counted as 7). 

If either the player or banker have an 8 or 9 at this point (known as a “natural”), then no more cards are drawn and that person wins automatically. If neither side has an 8 or 9, then one more card is drawn for both players (the banker always goes last). The highest card in each hand determines the winner - so if both players have the same highest card, then it is considered a push. 

Campobet Baccarat has simple rules and can be learned by anyone quickly! It's popular at live casinos for its speed of play - perfect for those who don't want to spend hours at a table!
