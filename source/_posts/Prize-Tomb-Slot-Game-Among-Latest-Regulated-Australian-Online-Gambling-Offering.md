#  Regulating Australian online gambling: the case of Egyptian Tombs

The Tomb of Tutankhamun, discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter, is among the most famous archaeological sites in the world. The wealth of artefacts and treasures found inside the tomb - including the boy king's sarcophagus, mummy and 241 gold vessels - made international headlines and captured the public's imagination. Ever since its discovery, there has been speculation over how much of the treasure was actually found in situ, and how much may have been removed or added by looters in the years following the tomb's opening.

In recent years, online gambling has grown increasingly popular in Australia. In 2012-13, Australians lost a total of $1.7 billion to online gambling sites, with around two-thirds of that figure gambled on pokies (slot machines). The popularity of online gambling has led to calls for greater regulation of the industry, with some arguing that it is ripe for exploitation by unscrupulous operators.

One proposal that has been put forward is to introduce an "Australian Tomb Raiders Tax" on online gambling operators based offshore. The tax would be levied at a rate of 10 percent of gross revenue, and would be used to fund research and recovery operations related to Australian archaeological sites.

The proposal has met with mixed reactions. Some support it as a way to protect Australia's cultural heritage, while others argue that it would simply drive gamblers to unregulated or black market sites overseas. There are also concerns that such a tax would place an unnecessary burden on legitimate operators and lead to job losses in the industry.

At this time it is unclear whether or not the Australian government will introduce measures to regulate online gambling. In the meantime, Australian gamblers can continue to enjoy all the excitement and suspense of online casino games without fear of being taken advantage of.

The Egyptian Tombs app will be available on both iOS and Android devices, and will include in-game microtransactions that allow players to purchase virtual items using real money. Aristocrat has stated that it will use “the latest in responsible gambling technologies” to ensure that players are able to enjoy the game without spending more than they can afford.

“This licence approval is a landmark moment for Aristocrat as it allows us to offer our Egyptian Tombs social gaming app in Victoria, after rigorous assessment by the VCGLR,” said Aristocrat CEO Trevor Croker. “ Egyptian Tombs is a highly engaging and fun game that we believe will be well received by players in Victoria.
