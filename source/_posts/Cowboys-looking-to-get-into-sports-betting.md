#  Cowboys looking to get into sports betting

The Dallas Cowboys are one of the most iconic franchises in all of sports, and now they’re looking to get into the sports betting industry. Owner Jerry Jones is exploring the possibility of creating a sportsbook at AT&T Stadium, which would be a massive new revenue stream for the team.

Jones has been meeting with various gambling experts in an effort to get up to speed on the ins and outs of sports betting. He believes that there’s a lot of potential in this market, and he wants the Cowboys to be on the forefront of it.

There’s no timeline yet for when a Cowboys sportsbook might open, but it’s clear that this is something that Jones is serious about. He sees it as a way to further enrich the fan experience at AT&T Stadium, and he also believes that it could be a major moneymaker for the team.

This would be a big move for the Cowboys, and it will be interesting to see how things progress from here. Jones is known for being one of the most innovative owners in all of sports, so it’s likely that he has some big plans for the Cowboys’ foray into sports betting.

#  Cowboys considering sports betting

The Dallas Cowboys are considering getting into the sports betting business, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The team is in preliminary talks with casino operators about partnering on a sportsbook at AT&T Stadium.

This would be a major shift for the Cowboys, who have long been one of the most traditional and conservative teams in the NFL. They have never had a gambling partnership of any kind, and they have resisted offers to put casinos inside their stadium.

But things are changing in the NFL, and gambling is becoming more and more mainstream. last year, the league approved a partnership between the Raiders and casino operator MGM Resorts International. That deal will see MGM operate a sportsbook at the new Las Vegas stadium that will be shared by the Raiders and UNLV football.

The Cowboys are apparently looking for a similar arrangement, with a casino operator taking on a majority ownership stake in the sportsbook. The team would presumably get a piece of the action as well, although it's not clear how much money they would make from it.

This is an interesting move for the Cowboys, and it will be interesting to see if they can pull it off. Gambling has always been a controversial topic in America, and there are sure to be some who object to putting a casino inside an NFL stadium.

But if the Cowboys can navigate those waters and get their sportsbook up and running, it could be a lucrative venture for them. The Las Vegas stadium has already proven that there is real demand for this type of product, and there is no reason to think that AT&T Stadium would be any different.

#  How the Cowboys could benefit from sports betting

The Dallas Cowboys have a storied history in the NFL, but they have not won a Super Bowl since 1995. Some experts believe that the team’s lack of success in recent years has to do with their reluctance to embrace sports betting. Now that the NFL has legalized sports gambling, the Cowboys could benefit from it more than ever before.
