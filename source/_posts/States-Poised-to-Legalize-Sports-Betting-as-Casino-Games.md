#  States Poised to Legalize Sports Betting as Casino Games

It appears that several US states are on the cusp of legalizing sports betting.

This would allow people in those states to bet on sporting events, as they do in countries like the United Kingdom and Australia.

Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting way back in 1951.

But up until recently, most other states have not allowed it.

That has started to change in recent years, as more and more states have realized that sports betting can be a major revenue stream.

In 2017, New Jersey became the first state to legalize sports betting since Nevada.

Since then, a number of other states have followed suit.

Oregon is one of the latest states to consider legalizing sports betting.

A bill that would allow sports betting was introduced in the Oregon legislature on February 7th.

The bill has gained bipartisan support, and it is expected to pass.

Once it does, Oregon will join a growing list of states that allow sports betting.

#  New Jersey Leads the Way in Legalizing Sports Betting 

On Monday, May 14th, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) as unconstitutional. This decision effectively opens the door for states to legalize sports betting. The next day, New Jersey lawmakers voted to approve a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state.

This is a major victory for Governor Chris Christie, who has been fighting for legalization since 2012. “I am thrilled to see the Supreme Court finally side with New Jersey and strike down the federal ban on sports betting,” Christie said in a statement. “This is a great day for freedom and democracy in America.”

Republican Senate President Stephen Sweeney was also ecstatic about the decision. “The legal sports betting industry will create thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars in economic activity,” Sweeney said. He went on to say that he plans to work with the governor to get the bill passed as quickly as possible.

Democratic Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto was more cautious in his statements, saying that they need to make sure that they put in place strong consumer protections before legalizing sports betting.

If the bill is passed, New Jersey would be the first state to allow sports betting since PASPA was enacted in 1992. Other states are likely to follow suit, as there is now an opportunity to generate significant revenue from this industry. In fact, one study estimates that legalized sports betting could generate up to $26 billion per year nationwide.

There are still some details that need to be worked out before New Jersey can officially legalize sports betting, but it appears that this process is moving forward at a rapid pace. Lawmakers are hopeful that they can have a bill ready for Governor Christie’s signature by the end of June.

#  Nevada Poised to Follow Suit and Legalize Sports Betting

Nevada is the only state in the US that currently allows sports betting. That looks like it might be changing soon, as New Jersey has already passed a bill to legalize it and other states are likely to follow suit.

The Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting last month, opening the door for individual states to legalize it. New Jersey was the first state to capitalize on this, passing a bill earlier this month that would allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks.

Other states are likely to follow suit, as there is now clear precedent for allowing sports betting. Nevada has been reaping the benefits of legalized sports betting for years, and other states are eager to get their share of the pie.

There is some opposition to legalizing sports betting, as there always is with any change. Some people argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction and other social ills. Others simply don’t see the point of legalizing something that is already happening illegally.

But overall, there seems to be a consensus that legalizing sports betting is a good idea. It will bring in much-needed revenue to states, create jobs, and boost tourism. And it won’t have a major negative impact on society.

So it’s likely that we will see more and more states legalizing sports betting in the coming months and years. This is a major shift in US gambling policy, and it will have a major impact on the industry.

#  Delaware Moves Forward with Legislation to Legalize Sports Betting

Governor John Carney (D-DE) has announced that he will sign into law a bill legalizing sports betting in Delaware, following the US Supreme Court's ruling in May that struck down a federal ban on the activity. The new law, which was passed by the Delaware legislature last week, will allow residents age 21 and older to place bets on professional and college sports at state-licensed casinos and online platforms.

Delaware is the first state to move forward with legislation following the Supreme Court's ruling; several other states, including New Jersey, are also considering similar measures. In anticipation of increased competition from surrounding states, Delaware's casinos have been preparing for legalized sports betting for months, investing in new software and training personnel. According to Brian Wallace, a spokesperson for Dover Downs Hotel & Casino, "We're just trying to be ready when it does happen."

Legalized sports betting is expected to bring in millions of dollars in additional revenue for Delaware's casinos and state government. In addition to taxable income from bets placed by residents, the new law also allows casinos to offer gambling services to out-of-state customers. This could provide a significant boost to Delaware's struggling gaming industry; according to figures from the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, casino gaming revenues in Delaware have declined by more than 20% since 2006.

There is some concern that legalized sports betting could lead to an increase in problem gambling rates; however, a study commissioned by the American Gaming Association found that such concerns are overblown. The study found that less than 2% of Americans who bet on sports are problem gamblers, and that most people who bet on sports do so responsibly.

#  California Weighs In on the Possibility of Legalizing Sports Betting

In a recent development, the state of California has announced its intention to legalize sports betting. The state is currently considering a bill that would allow for licensing and regulation of sports betting operations. The proposed bill would permit any “bona fide” business to offer sports betting, including horseracing tracks, Indian casinos, and online platforms.

The proposed bill has generated a great deal of interest and discussion. Proponents point to the potential benefits of legalizing sports betting, including increased tax revenue and the creation of new jobs. Critics argue that the risks associated with gambling are too great, and that legalization would lead to increased rates of problem gambling.

Despite opposition, the likelihood that the proposed bill will be passed into law appears to be high. Sports betting is already legal in a number of states, including Nevada and New Jersey, and several other states are currently considering similar bills. In light of this trend, it seems likely that sports betting will eventually become legal nationwide.
