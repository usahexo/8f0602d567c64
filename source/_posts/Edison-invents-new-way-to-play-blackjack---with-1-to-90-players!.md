#  Edison invents new way to play blackjack - with 1 to 90 players!

Playing blackjack in a casino can be a lot of fun, but it's even more fun when you can play with friends - and now, thanks to Thomas Edison, there's a new way to do just that!

Edison has invented a new blackjack game that allows up to 90 players to play at the same time. The game is played with 3 decks of cards, and each player is given 5 cards. The goal is to create the best hand possible by adding together the values of your cards.

The player who has the highest total hand wins the game. If two or more players have the same total hand, the player with the highest value card wins. In case of a tie, the pot is split between the winners.

Edison's new blackjack game provides hours of excitement and fun for players of all ages. So next time you're in Vegas, be sure to check out this new game and see if you can win big!

#  Blackjack just got even more exciting with Edison's new rules!

In response to the overwhelming popularity of Blackjack, Edison Casino has just announced a new set of rules that will make the game even more exciting and challenging.

The basic rules of Blackjack remain the same - you attempt to draw cards that total 21, or as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player who achieves this first wins the hand.

In addition to the traditional rules, Edison Casino is now introducing a number of new features:

* A side bet that pays out based on your first two cards. For example, if your first two cards are an Ace and a King, you win 5 times your bet!

* Doubling down is now available on any two cards, not just those of equal value. This gives players more opportunities to increase their winnings.

* If you split a pair of Jacks or Tens, you can now re-split them up to 3 times for a total of 4 hands! This gives players even more chances to win big.

So come on down to Edison Casino and try out our new Blackjack rules! You're sure to have a blast!

#  Get your game on with Edison's revolutionary blackjack rules!

It's Friday night, and you're feeling lucky. You pull out your trusty deck of cards and challenge your friends to a game of blackjack. But wait - what are the rules? You vaguely remember reading about some new kind of blackjack that Edison invented, but you can't remember the specifics.

Fear not, intrepid cardplayer! We're here to help.

Edison's blackjack is played with one or more decks of cards, as usual. The goal is to reach 21 points without going over, or to score more points than your opponent without going over.

The big difference in Edison's blackjack is that players can draw up to five cards per hand. In other words, you don't have to stick with two cards like you do in traditional blackjack. This makes the game a lot more exciting - and a lot more risky!

If you're feeling daring, you can try Edison's blackjack variant called "double down". This means that if you think you've got a good hand, you can double your bet and receive just one more card. If you go over 21 with this card, you lose automatically, so be careful!

There are a few other rules that apply specifically to Edison's blackjack:

- A player cannot split two aces.

- A player cannot receive more than one card after splitting pairs.

- If both players reach 21 on the same hand, the player with the higher individual card value wins automatically (aces are high).


That's all there is to know about playing Edison's blackjack! So put on your poker face and get ready for some exciting gambling action.

#  Play blackjack like never before with Edison's new 1 to 90 rule set!

If you're like most blackjack players, you probably play using the basic strategy chart. While this is a great way to improve your odds, there are ways to further increase your chances of winning by playing with a different set of rules. This is where Edison's 1 to 90 rule set comes in!

With this rule set, you can increase your chances of winning by up to 5%. Here's how it works: instead of doubling down on 11 or doubling down against a 2 or 3, you can instead choose to hit. This may seem like a minor change, but it can make a big difference when it comes to your bottom line.

Another advantage of this rule set is that it allows you to stand on 17 against a 6 rather than hitting. Again, this may seem like a minor adjustment, but it can help to improve your odds significantly.

If you're looking for a way to take your blackjack game up a notch, be sure to check out Edison's 1 to 90 rule set!
