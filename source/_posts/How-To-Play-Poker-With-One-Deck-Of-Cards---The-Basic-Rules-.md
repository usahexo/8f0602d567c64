#  How To Play Poker With One Deck Of Cards - The Basic Rules 

In this article we are going to teach you how to play poker with one deck of cards. The basic rules are very simple and easy to learn.

First, you will need to gather a deck of 52 cards and form two equal stacks, face down. One stack will be for the player and the other will be for the dealer. 

The player then starts by flipping over the top card from their stack. This is their card. If the player has any other cards of the same rank as their first card, they can place them face up in front of them. For example, if they flipped over a 9 of clubs, they could put any 9s they have (clubs or not) face up in front of them. The player can only put down one card for each rank; they cannot put down two 5s for example. 

After the player has played all their cards, it is now the dealer's turn. The dealer flips over the next card from their stack and this becomes their card. If the dealer has any other cards of the same rank as their first card, they must place them face down in front of them. However, if the dealer does not have any other cards of that rank, they can either place another card from their stack face up or put down a wildcard (which we will explain later). 

Once both players have finished playing all their cards, whoever has the highest ranking hand wins! The four suits are clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥), and spades (♠). There are 13 ranks in each suit: Ace (A), 2 (2), 3 (3), 4 (4), 5 (5), 6 (6), 7 (7), 8 (8), 9 (9), 10 (10), Jack (J), Queen(Q) and King(K). A full list of hands can be found below: 

One Pair - A pair consists of two cards of equal rank. For example, two 2s or two Aces. 
Two Pair - Two pairs consist of two cards of equal rank plus two different cards of equal rank. For example, two 2s, plus two 4s or two Queens plus two Kings. 
Three Of A Kind - Three cards of the same rank. For example, three 6s or three Kings. 
Straight - Five consecutive ranked cards regardless of suit eights-low through aces-high). So it could be 7 ♥ 8 ♦ 9 ♣ 10 ♠ or 2 ♠ 3 ♥ 4 ♣ 5♦ .  
Flush - All five cards are from the same suit which does not have to be consecutive eights-low through aaces-high). So it could be 5 ♥ 6♥ 7♦ 8♣ 9♦ or K♥ Q♦ J♣ 10♥ .  
Full House - A full house is made up by three cards of one rank plus two cards of another rank eights-low through aces-high). So it could be 3♥ 3♦ 3♠ 2♥ 2♣ or 8♠ 8♦ 8♥ 7♣ 7♦ . 
Four Of A Kind - Four cards with the same rank eights-low through aces-high). So it could be 4♥ 4♦ 4♠ 3♥ 3♣ or A♦ A♥ A♣ 2♦ 2♠ . 
Straight Flush - Five consecutive ranked suited cards eights-low through aces-high). So it could be 7 ♥ 8 ♦ 9 ♣ 10 ♠ just like with a regular straight but with suits insteadof numbers! 

And thats how you play poker with one deck!

#  Playing Poker With One Standard Deck Of Cards 

There are many different ways that poker can be played. One popular variation is to use just one standard deck of cards. This is a great option for beginners, as it is a relatively simple game that still provides plenty of excitement.

In this variation, each player is dealt five cards. The aim of the game is to make the best possible hand using any combination of your five cards and the community cards, which are placed face-up in the middle of the table. The player with the best hand at the end of the game wins.

There are a few different betting rounds during play. In the first round, each player places an ante bet. In subsequent rounds, players either raise their bets or fold depending on what they hold in their hand. The dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand, and the next hand begins once all players have either placed their bets or folded.

Here are some of the hands you can make in poker with one standard deck of cards:

One Pair - Two cards of the same rank

Two Pairs - Two different pairs

Three of a Kind - Three cards of the same rank

Straight - Five consecutive card ranks (e.g. 9♥ 10♠ J♦ Q♣ K♥)

Flush - Five cards all of the same suit (e.g. 2♣ 3♦ 6♥ 7♠ 8♥)

Full House - Three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank (e.g. K♠ K♦ Q♥ J♦)

Four of a Kind - Four cards of the same rank (e.g A♦ A♥ 2♦ 2♣)
