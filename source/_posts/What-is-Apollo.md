#  What is Apollo?

Apollo is an open source project that enables businesses to build or migrate their applications to the cloud. It provides a comprehensive platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications in the cloud. Apollo is also designed to make it easier for businesses to connect with other cloud services and manage their overall cloud infrastructure.

# Apollo Architecture

Here’s a high-level overview of Apollo’s architecture:

1. The Apollo Platform consists of three major components: the Apollo Core, the Apollo Agent, and the Apollo Management Console.

2. The Apollo Core provides the basic functionality for developing, deploying, and managing applications in the cloud. It includes the Apollo Engine, which handles application deployment and execution, and the Apollo Registry, which stores information about applications and services.

3. The Apollo Agent connects applications running in the cloud with other services running in different clouds or on-premises installations. It also manages communication between the Apollo Core and other services.

4. The Apollo Management Console provides a web-based interface for managing applications and services deployed in the cloud. It includes tools for creating new applications, configuring application settings, monitoring application status, and accessing logs and performance data.

The following diagram shows how these components interact with each other:





















       (    ONLINE_APOLLO_DOCS ) _) Here's a high-level overview of how ]_(Apollo's components work together: 1) \/ The core part of /\/ Apollo is called `the engine'. This is where all your code lives while it runs in PaaS mode(https://docs.apollocloud.org/latest/developer_guide/paas_mode), telling it what resources to use etc etc 2) `The agent' & `the broker' are how your app talks to anything else not on apollo--remember 3 kinds of things: things on apollo (clients), things managed by apollo(services), everything else (other clouds & resource providers). There are plugins for most common ones BUT if you have a super custom thing or just hate installing plugins then you can write your own integrations in ruby--see our cookbook for recipes https://github.com/apollodata/apollo-cookbook). 3) The management console is where you go to see what's going on with your app(s)--it gives both detailed & summarized information as well as one-stop access to all logs across all of your apps 4) Last thing on this diagram is that `the engine' talks to K8S or ECS directly OR via our open source orchestration layer 'Octopus'. If you're using K8S then you're pretty much done at this point--see our getting started guide https://docs.apollocloud.org/latest/developer_guide/kubernetes_integration) 5) If you're using ECS then read on! 6) As of right now there is no direct integration with ECS but we do have some docs on how to get started https://docs.apollocloud.org/latest/developer_guide/ecs_integration). Basically you need two things: an image that points to apollo & a launch configuration that sets up some environment variables 7) Once you have those two things set up then deploy away! You can use both CLI & UI commands to do so 8) That's it! We hope this gives you a high-level understanding of how everything works together :)
