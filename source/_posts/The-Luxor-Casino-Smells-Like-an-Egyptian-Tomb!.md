#  The Luxor Casino Smells Like an Egyptian Tomb!

The Luxor Casino in Las Vegas has a strange smell. It smells like an Egyptian tomb! I don't know why, but it does.

Some people might think that's a good thing, because it's exotic. But to me, it just smells bad. It's like a mix of old musty books and disinfectant.

I'm not the only one who thinks this. A lot of people have said on TripAdvisor that the casino smells bad. One person even said it smelled like "a dead animal".

I don't know if they've ever been inside an Egyptian tomb, but if they have, they would know that it doesn't smell like disinfectant! Tomb air is dry and dusty, with a faint smell of decay.

The Luxor Casino should really invest in some better air fresheners!

#  What Does the Luxor Hotel Casino Smell Like? Try Egypt!

The Luxor Hotel Casino is located on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. It is owned and operated by MGM Resorts International. The hotel has a pyramid shaped tower that is illuminated with a light beam that shoots into the sky. The hotel opened in 1993.

The Luxor Hotel Casino smells like a combination of sandalwood, jasmine, and ylang-ylang. These scents were chosen to represent different aspects of ancient Egypt. The sandalwood scent is representative of the wood used in ancient Egyptian furniture. The jasmine scent represents the flowers that were often found in ancient Egyptian gardens. The ylang-ylang scent represents the oil made from the flowers of the ylang-ylang tree which was used in ancient Egyptian hair treatments.
