In the Oklahoma City Thunder's new sports betting commercial, Cleopatra makes an appearance. But who plays Cleopatra in the commercial?

The actress who plays Cleopatra in the Thunder's new sports betting commercial is none other than Claudia Wells. Wells is known for her role as Jennifer Parker in the classic '80s movie "Back to the Future."

In the commercial, Wells can be seen playing basketball and giving some words of wisdom to the Thunder players. She even gets into a little bit of trash talk with Steven Adams.

Adams had nothing but good things to say about working with Wells. "She was great," Adams said. "A really, really cool lady."

#  Oklahoma City Thunder's New Sports Betting Commercial Features Who Plays Cleopatra? 

This fall, the Oklahoma City Thunder NBA team will debut a new advertising campaign for its sports betting app. The commercial features popular singer and actor Jordin Sparks as Cleopatra. The spot will air on local television and be featured prominently during Oklahoma City Thunder games.

The commercial begins with a shot of the team's logo, followed by a close up of Cleopatra's eye. The camera then pans out to show her in all her glory, reclining on a bed of gold coins. Cleopatra sings about the excitement of sports betting, while various scenes of people betting on sports play out in the background.

At one point in the ad, Cleopatra wagers her own jewels against someone who is betting their house. In another scene, she bets on a horse race and wins big. The commercial ends with Cleopatra sitting atop her golden throne, counting her winnings and proclaiming that there is nothing as thrilling as "placing your bets with the Thunder."

The new sports betting ad campaign is part of an effort by the Oklahoma City Thunder to attract more fans to its app. The Thunder already has a strong following in Oklahoma, but team officials believe that the sports betting app could be even more popular if more people knew about it.

The campaign will include commercials, social media posts, and even some signage at the Chesapeake Energy Arena, where the Thunder play their home games. Officials for the team say that they are confident that the new ads will help raise awareness for the sports betting app and boost its popularity among fans.

#  Who is Playing Cleopatra in the Oklahoma City Thunder's New Commercial? 

In the newest commercial for the Oklahoma City Thunder, actress Keegan-Michael Key portrays Cleopatra. This decision has stirred up some controversy among OKC fans, as many feel that he is not a good fit for the role.

Key is most well-known for his work on the TV show "Key and Peele". He has also appeared in several movies, including "Comedian", "Get Him to the Greek", and "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes". 

Some Thunder fans have expressed concern that Key's comedic acting style will not be appropriate for a commercial that is meant to promote a professional basketball team. They argue that Cleopatra should be portrayed as a serious and regal figure, not someone who is trying to make people laugh. 

Others believe that Key's humor will add a fresh new perspective to the commercial and that it could end up being one of the team's most popular ads yet. They are looking forward to seeing how he incorporates his signature humor into the role of Cleopatra. 

At this point, it is unclear how the public will react to Key's portrayal of Cleopatra. However, it is sure to be an interesting watch no matter what happens.

#  The Oklahoma City Thunder Release Their New Sports Betting Commercial Starring Who Plays Cleopatra? 

On July 9, 2019, the Oklahoma City Thunder released a new sports betting commercial starring who plays Cleopatra?. The 30-second ad features a Julius Caesar character playing the role of a sports gambler and placing bets on the Thunder. The commercial then cuts to Cleopatra and her friends watching the game, cheering for their team and gambling on the outcome.

The commercial ends with the tagline, "the gods of gaming are with OKC." While it's not clear if the Thunder are actually partners with any online sportsbooks, it's clear that they're looking to capitalize on the increasing popularity of legal sports betting in the United States.

According to Adam Caparell of Sports Illustrated, this is just one of many recent NBA commercials that have focused on gambling. In fact, he argues that the league has embraced gambling as a way to attract new fans and generate additional revenue. This appears to be true in Oklahoma City as well, where the Thunder have partnered with local casinos to offer promotions and discounts to those who bet on their games.

While there is some risk associated with legalized sports betting, it's clear that teams like the Thunder are doing everything they can to take advantage of this growing industry. With more states opening up their markets and mobile betting becoming increasingly popular, it's likely that we'll see even more commercials like this in the years ahead.
